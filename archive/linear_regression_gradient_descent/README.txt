This file contains a linear regression that has had a batch update gradient descent algorithm applied to it for the purpose of 
minimizing the associated cost function.

The linear regression and gradient descent algorithms were created from scratch, 
without using any available R packages or libraries.

Different learning rates, convergence thresholds, and iterations were experimented with. 

The results of these experiments were then plotted for visualization.
