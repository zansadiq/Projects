This file contains a program to produce a national ranking of all hospitals in the US. The  input data is from the medicare.gov Hospital Compare database. 

The database was downloaded into memory and then cleaned for readability and analysis. 
A proprietary formula was used to create the rankings and a list of focus states with poor results. 
For each state in the list of focus states, an output was created ranking the top 100 hospitals. 
Another workbook was created to analyze the numerical statistics of all hospitals, as well as of those in the focus states.
