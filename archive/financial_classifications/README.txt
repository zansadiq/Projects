This file contains two programs:1) Program to scrape and interpret JSON files from the internet and input their results into a locally-stored .csv file2) A program to run several different algorithms on the .csv file in order to predict classifications of the dataThe purpose of this project was to predict bitcoin prices for a cryptocurrency hedge fund. The data was classified based upon a +/- 5% fluctuation in price using a rolling time frame of the past 24-hours. Each row was correspondingly classified with the labels, “buy”, “hold”, or “sell”. Machine learning algorithms were then ran to predict these classifications. The most effective algorithm was the neural network.
