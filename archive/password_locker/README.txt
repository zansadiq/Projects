This folder contains a Commond-Line Interface used to generate new, unique passwords and also store them for reference. 

The passwords are generated and then stored in a master file that contains: date of creation, site name, user_id, & password.

The master file is also stored on disk in a user-specified location. 

The file will also be uploaded to dropbox. In order to do this, 
you must first visit dropbox.com and create a developer account which will allow you to create an app. 
Generate an access token and use this information when prompted via the CLI.
