This file contains an analysis of two different datasets. 

The first dataset contains proprietary cryptocurrency pricing information. 
This dataset was created using a Python program to scrape information from internet websites. 

The crypocurrencies compared in the dataset are bitcoin and ethereum.
Pricing information was recorded on a timescale of every minute for several weeks. 
The blockchain information was also collected.

This information was used to predict price fluctuations in bitcoin using support vector machines and decision trees. 
Radial and linear kernels were used for the SVM. The decision tree was also computed using boosting. 

The second dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
It contains information produced by a Portugese banking institution. 
The information is demographic and marketing-related in nature.
It contains the results of a marketing campaign encouraging customers to enroll in bank term deposits. 
The goal here was to predict whether or not the customer would enroll, based on their demographic information and the results of the marketing efforts. 

In order to run the program:
1) Make sure all libraries are installed
2) Set working directory
3) Change file location for “read.csv”
4) Run program
