This file contains an experimentation with boostrapping a Bayesian Network.

The goal was to determine conditional probabilities for possible 
outcomes in patients dependent upon their previous medical history.

The bootstrapped probabilities were used to establish confidence intervals at the 5% level of significance. 

The data that was used was a medical history file. 

The available fields were H(history of smoking, B(bronchitis is present, L(lung disease is present, 
F(patient is complaining of fatigue), and C (chest X-ray is positive).  
All fields were encoded as Y or N.
