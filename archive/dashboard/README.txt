This file contains the code for creating a minimal, interactive dashboard in python using the package `dash`.

The dashboard is created with information provided by the City of Chicago. 
That can be downloaded [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2). 

The data should be downloaded as a ".csv" file and placed in the intended working directory named "chicago_crime.csv".

** Please note: the app takes a long time to run due to the size of the db file
