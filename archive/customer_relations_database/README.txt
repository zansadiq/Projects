This file contains SQL code to create a database. 

The database is to store information for a company that creates Customer Rewards programs for small businesses. 

The database stores information on each client, as well as their inventories and customers. 
It tracks the rewards and surveys sent out by companies and awards customers points based on purchasing. 

This file also contains a second file to input dummy data into the database.  

The last file includes sample queries that can be run against the database to produce relevant queries for customer analysis.
