KNN classification and Artificial Neural Networks:

The purpose of this project is to use KNN and an artificial neural network to perform a predictive classification task 
on two different datasets, and measure performance. 

The data used for this project is the same as that used in the "support_vector_machines_decision_trees" folder. 

This data is the bank-data file from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, 
as well as a proprietary dataset created by the author on cryptocurrency pricing information. 

In order to run the program:
1) Make sure all libraries are installed
2) Set working directory
3) Change file location for “read.csv”
4) Run program
